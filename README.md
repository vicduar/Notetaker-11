##Installation:

The project was created using VS Code editor where Express.js was used. It was then uploaded to a Github repository. The server was initiated in the terminal using Node. It was deployed on Render.
##Usage:
Open the terminal. Since there is already a package.json file, the next step is to enter “npm i” into the terminal to load all necessary files to the project. “Npm start” is then used to turn the server on. Once the server is on (listening on port 3001) then the project may be opened in the browser.
